# Lily58 × qtkb Glow + Rotary Encoders designed for Wireless

Lily58 is 6×4+4keys column-staggered split keyboard.

This is a project to edit the Lily58 x qtkb Glow + Rotary Encoders to make it easily compatible with wireless settings. This is designed for the nice!nano, and will have a battery disconnect switch, no TRRS jack, and underglow LEDs (a later task is to add per-key LEDs). Very much a work in progress until there is an initial release. Hoping to have this modified and ready shortly after I receive my Boardsource.xyz Lulu (Lily58 compatible) case. Stay tuned!
