# Lily58 × qtkb Glow + Rotary Encoders designed for Wireless

Lily58 is 6×4+4keys column-staggered split keyboard.

This is a project to edit the Lily58 x qtkb Glow + Rotary Encoders to make it easily compatible with wireless settings. This is designed for the nice!nano, and will have a battery disconnect switch, no TRRS jack, backlight per-key LEDs with a power switch. Very much a work in progress until there is an initial release. Hoping to have this modified and ready shortly after I receive my Boardsource.xyz Lulu (Lily58 compatible) case. Stay tuned!

### 3/31/2022 Work is progressing. I am struggling to find a solid SPDT switch that will be easily reachable for LED purposes. But I think I've got it figured out besides that.

### 05/03/2022 Ordered some test kits from JLCPCB, already figured out that I made some LED errors, but that will be a good bit of work to fix. When those are fixed, plus whatever other issues, and the firmware is written, V1 will be released. If I continue to work on it after that, I hope to add underglow LEDs as a V2, and convert to SMD and Thru-Hole diodes. Until that time, I won't upload any gerber files. Hopefully, I will be able to run some sort of a group buy of PCBs and slide switches, but that is TBD.


Needed Parts for a full keyboard:
*2x PCB
*2x OS102011MA1QN1 Slide Switch
*2x nice!nano
*56x Hotswap sockets
*60x SK6812 mini-E LEDs
*58x 1N4148W Thru-hole LEDs (not SMD yet)
