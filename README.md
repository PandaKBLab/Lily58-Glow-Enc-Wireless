# Lily58 × qtkb Glow + Rotary Encoders designed for Wireless

Lily58 is 6×4+4keys column-staggered split keyboard.

This is a project to edit the Lily58 x qtkb Glow + Rotary Encoders to make it easily compatible with wireless settings. This is designed for the nice!nano, and will have a battery disconnect switch, no TRRS jack, backlight per-key LEDs with a power switch. Very much a work in progress until there is an initial release. Hoping to have this modified and ready shortly after I receive my Boardsource.xyz Lulu (Lily58 compatible) case. Stay tuned!

## V1 is a go! I think this should all be working PCB wise, firmware isn't yet ready, but I've placed a JLCPCB order for some prototypes, ordered all the pieces, and lots of the switches. If this works once I get the firmware ready, I'll daily drive it for a bit to verify no issues and then run a group buy. - May 4th, 2022
