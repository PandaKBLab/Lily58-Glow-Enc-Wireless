# Lily58 × qtkb Glow + Rotary Encoders designed for Wireless

Lily58 is 6×4+4keys column-staggered split keyboard.

This is a project to edit the Lily58 x qtkb Glow + Rotary Encoders to make it easily compatible with wireless settings. This is designed for the nice!nano, and will have a battery disconnect switch, no TRRS jack, backlight per-key LEDs with a power switch. Very much a work in progress until there is an initial release. Hoping to have this modified and ready shortly after I receive my Boardsource.xyz Lulu (Lily58 compatible) case. Stay tuned!

## V1 Works without LEDs
Cost about $10 to order from JLCPCB, but LEDs are wired wrong. The Gerber has been uploaded to the release, and I will slowly be working on fixing the LEDs for the SK6812 mini-e

## V2 Firmware released, early LED support
Added early LED support, but I don't have a board that works with them yet. Getting to the point that I am going to split the board up into a Left and Right side
