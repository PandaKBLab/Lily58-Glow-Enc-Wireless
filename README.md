# Lily58 × qtkb Glow + Rotary Encoders designed for Wireless

Lily58 is 6×4+4keys column-staggered split keyboard.

This is a project to edit the Lily58 x qtkb Glow + Rotary Encoders to make it easily compatible with wireless settings. This is designed for the nice!nano, and will have a battery disconnect switch, no TRRS jack, DIP switches to control power to OLED, per-key LEDs, and underglow LEDs. Very much a work in progress until there is an initial release. Hoping to have this modified and ready shortly after I receive my Boardsource.xyz Lulu (Lily58 compatible) case. Stay tuned!

### 3/31/2022 Work is progressing. I am struggling to find a solid SPDT switch that will be easily reachable for LED purposes. But I think I've got it figured out besides that.



Needed Parts for a full keyboard:
2x PCB
2x AS13AH SPDT switch
2x OS102011MA1QN1 Slide Switch
